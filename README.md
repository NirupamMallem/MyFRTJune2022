### Industry*: 
ED-Tech

### Problem Statement/Opportunity*:

Education is the most powerful tool that one can have. Unfortunately, there are many students in India who are not in a position to get a proper education. Reasons vary from one person to the other. But, the most common reason is their financial status. Parents are not able to afford the heavy fee structure of colleges. So, many students are choosing to stop their education after class 10 and go to work to earn some bucks. Indirectly, this scenario is one of the reasons for the growth of unemployment in India. So, my project is going to resolve this to some extent.


### Project Description*:


My project is to build a web application that is useful to the students. The name of my website is Nirupam University. Nirupam University solves the problem of poor students who cannot afford the heavy fee structure of colleges. Study materials are available for every course at Nirupam University. Students can download them free of cost. Video lectures are also available which help students to get to know about the concepts they want in detail. Students can get more benefits from the premium courses available at Nirupam University. After learning something, it is very important to test one's knowledge of what he/she has learned. So, at Nirupam University, students get a facility to test their knowledge through quizzes available after every topic in a chapter. A course completion certificate is issued to the students after they successfully complete a course. I included this feature so that students get more enthusiastic about learning. Finally, it is an attempt to help the students who are willing to study but whose financial situations are not letting them do so.
